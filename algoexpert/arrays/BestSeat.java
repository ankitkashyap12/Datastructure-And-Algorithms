 *   You walk into a theatre you're about to see a show in. The usher within the
 *   theatre walks you to your row and mentions you're allowed to sit anywhere
 *   within the given row. Naturally you'd like to sit in the seat that gives you
 *   the most space. You also would prefer this space to be evenly distributed on
 *   either side of you (e.g. if there are three empty seats in a row, you would
 *   prefer to sit in the middle of those three seats).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   Given the theatre row represented as an integer array, return
 *   the seat index of where you should sit. Ones represent occupied seats and zeroes
 *   represent empty seats.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   You may assume that someone is always sitting in the
 *   first and last seat of the row. Whenever there are two equally good seats,
 *   you should sit in the seat with the lower index. If there is no seat to sit
 *   in, return -1. The given array will always have a length of at least one
 *   and contain only ones and zeroes.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Sample Input</h3>
 * <pre><span class="CodeEditor-promptParameter">seats</span> = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
 * </pre>
 * <h3>Sample Output</h3>
