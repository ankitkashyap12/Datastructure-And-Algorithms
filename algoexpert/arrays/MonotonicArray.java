 * Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a boolean

 * <p>
 * An array is said to be monotonic if its elements, from left to right, are
 * entirely non-increasing or entirely non-decreasing.
 * <p>
 * Non-increasing elements aren't necessarily exclusively decreasing; they simply
 * don't increase. Similarly, non-decreasing elements aren't necessarily
 * exclusively increasing; they simply don't decrease.</p>
